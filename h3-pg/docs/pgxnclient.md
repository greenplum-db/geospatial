# PGXN Client

> `pgxnclient` does not normally ship with PostgreSQL, so you will probably have to install it manually.

The [PGXN Client](https://pgxn.github.io/pgxnclient/) is a command line tool designed to interact with the [PostgreSQL Extension Network](https://pgxn.org/) allowing searching, compiling, installing, and removing extensions in PostgreSQL databases.

## Ubuntu

On Ubuntu you can install using `apt`

```bash
apt-get install pgxnclient
```

## MacOS

On MacOs you can install using `brew`

```bash
brew install pgxnclient
```
